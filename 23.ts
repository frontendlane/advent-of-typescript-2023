// Connect 4, but in TypeScript types
// Your goal for this challenge is to implement Connect 4 in TypeScript types.
// Each cell in the game can contain 游댮 or 游리 or be empty ( ). You're provided with a rough layout of how to organize the board in the EmptyBoard type. The game state is represented by an object with a board property and a state property (which keeps track of which player is next up to play).
// What is Connect 4
// In case you haven't played it before: Connect 4 is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
//     fun fact: Connect 4 is also known as Connect Four, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union
//     another fun fact: Connect 4 was "solved" by James Allen and Victor Allis (independently from one another.. like two weeks apart!) in 1988. They couldn't do a full brute-force proof at the time, but 7 years later John Tromp in the Netherlands did it with a database on a Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics International worksations (for a combined total of 40,000 computation hours!).
